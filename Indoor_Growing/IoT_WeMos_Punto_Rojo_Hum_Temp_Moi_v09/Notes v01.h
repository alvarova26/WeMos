// ############################## IoT Project to Pub/Sub measurements via MQTT Broker CloudMQTT from WeMos D1 R1

/* ############################## Version Index
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v00
  => Initial version
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v01 
  => Security version (Larika almost deletes all the code, so just in case...).
Larika DID something, I had to reconfigure completly the Arduino IDE and VS Code. I don't know
what she did, but I have to take more care about it.
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v02
  => Added functionality to clear the system's alarm memory and sensor's failure memory
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v03
  => Correction in the tem/hum/moi_logic functions
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v04
  => New approach in order to reduce the heat inside the IGS
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v05
  => New functionality to alternate illumination's status
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v06
  => HW/SW problem detecte - Some change in order to address the problem (lib/code/etc.).
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v07
  => Code developed to use the version 6.x.x of ArduinoJson library.
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v08
  => Code improved to keep the running time (with Chrono library and the millis() function).
  => Actually, just for running time  millis() is used. Chrono could be used in future applications.
  => Improving the code to allow the cental LED turn ON and OFF automatcially (refer to code updated 20220630)
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v09
  => Improving the code to allow ON/OFF alternation and rotation of LEDs (refer to code updated 20220703)
  => Imroveing strategy with new functions (check_illum(), check_onoff(), check_rot(), etc).

/* ############################## Project's Description
The device (WeMos D1 R1 chipset with ESP8266 onborad) will report:
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Moisture (%)
- PH of Soil (#) - Future Use

/* ############################## Relay's LOGIC
All relays will be set using the Normal Open logigc. This means that if there is a lack of energy
the LEDs and FANs will be automatically turned off.
So, the initail status of all relays will be NO

LED_A   =>  Relay controling the central LED of the Indoor Setup
 ______
|.    .|
|  x   |
|.____.|

LED_B   =>  Relay controling 2 periferial LEDs of the Indoor Seput
 ______
|x    .|
|  .   |
|.____x|

LED_C   =>  Relay controling the remaining 2 periferial LEDs of the Indoor Seput
 ______
|.    x|
|  .   |
|x____.|

FAN_A   =>  Relay controling the FANs for INPUT and OUTPUT air flow of the Indoor Setup

This three LED's relays will allow seven different configurations of illumination:
 ______  ______  ______  ______  ______  ______  ______ 
|.    .||x    .||.    x||x    .||.    x||x    x||x    x|
|  x   ||  .   ||  .   ||  x   ||  x   ||  .   ||  x   |
|.____.||.____x||x____.||.____x||x____.||x____x||x____x|
  VLOW    LOWA    LOWB    MIDA    MIDB    HIGH    VHIG
* An additional configuration has been added: ON/OFF operation - to allow the LEDs to be turned
on and off autmatically.

And five different levels of illumination:
Very Low  =>  LED_A's relay activated
Low (x2)  =>  LED_B's or LED_C's relay activated
Mid (x2)  =>  LED_A's and (LED_B's or LED_C's) relays activated
High      =>  LED_B's and LED_C's relays activated
Very Hig  =>  LED_A's and LED_B's and LED_C's relays activated
* ONOFF   =>  LED_A's relay alternating the status ON/OFF

On the other hand, the only one remaining relay will control the FANs for air circulation
Circulation   => FAN_A's realys activated

If digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH)  => Writes 3V to PIN => Relay Deactivated => Original NO/NC status.
If digitalWrite(PIN, LOW)   => Writes 0V to PIN => Relay Activated => Inverted NO/NC status

/* ############################## Calibrating Sensors
DHT22   =>  It is not necessary to calibrate this sensor (already calbirated in factory)
MOI     =>  Even that in some sites I found that it is recommended to feed the sensor with 5v, the current project considers 3.3v.
            The capacitive sensor needs to be calibrated with values of air (considered "dry") and water. This values
            will be "reference" to the function map(), as below:
            moi_raw = map(moi_unr, AirValue, WaterValue, 0, 100);
            moi_raw will be the value of the soil's moisture as a percentage, published on MQTT.
            As 20210629, cloudy day here in Salvador and very high ambient humidity (70%) I've measured:
            AirValue = 664 (set the value to 680 in order to adjust the humidity of the air)
            Water Value = 328 (set the value to 310 in order to adjust how much wet is the soil)

https://www.ledgrowlightsdepot.com/blogs/blog/16326275-how-many-led-watts-are-required-per-square-foot-of-grow-space

Recommended wattage assuming 1.0 sq ft/plant
Plants  Sq Ft   Watts
1       1 	    30 to 40 watts
2 	    2 	    60 to 80 watts
4 	    4 	    120 to 140 watts
6 	    6 	    180 to 200 watts

 Recommended wattage assuming 2.0 sq ft/plant
Plants  Sq Ft   Watts
1 	    2 	    60 to 80 watts
2 	    4 	    120 to 140 watts
4 	    8 	    240 to 300 watts

Metric equivalences:
1 f     =>  3048 cm
1 SqFt  =>  0.092903 m2
The Indoor Growing Setup has 36,4 cm x 36,7 cm x 80,0 cm
So... it  would be about 36,4 x 36,7 = 0,1336 m2 => 1,44 SqFt
Finally, rounding... the IGS has aprox. 1,5 SqFt for just one plant.
That give us a range of about 50 to 70 watts.

The LEDs I bought are aprox. 28w each (there are five in total).
With this calculation, the optimal configuration would be 2-3 LEDs turned on at a given time.
