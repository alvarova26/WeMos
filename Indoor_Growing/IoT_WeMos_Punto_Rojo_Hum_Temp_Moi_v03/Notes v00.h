// ############################## IoT Project to Pub/Sub measurements via MQTT Broker CloudMQTT 

/* ############################## Version Index
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v00
  => Initial version
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v01 
  => Security version (Larika almost deletes all the code, so just in case...).
Larika DID something, I had to reconfigure completly the Arduino IDE and VS Code. I don't know
what she did, but I have to take more care about it.
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v02
  => Added functionality to clear the system's alarm memory and sensor's failure memory
IoT_WeMos_Punto_Rojo_Hum_Temp_Moi_v03
  => Correction in the tem/hum/moi_logic functions

/* ############################## Project's Description
The device (WeMos D1 R1 chipset with ESP8266 onborad) will report:
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Moisture (%)
- PH of Soil (#) - Future Use
- Open/Close Door (On/Off) - Future Use
Along other measurements, every 10 sec via CloudMQTT Broker (using mqtt protocol)
At the same time, WeMos will accept commands form MQTT Broker (Publish/subscribe)  */

/* ############################## Relay's LOGIC
All relays will be set using the Normal Open logigc. This means that if there is a lack of energy
the LEDs and FAN will be automatically turned off.
So, the initail status of all relays will be NO

LED_1   =>  Relay controling the central LED of the Indoor Setup  
LED_4   =>  Relay controling the periferial LEDs of the Indor Seput
FAN_I   =>  Relay controling the FAN for INPUT air flow into the Indoor Setup
FAN_O   =>  Relay controling the FAN for OUTPUT air flow of the Indoor Setup

This two LED's relays will allow three different levels of illumination inside the Indoor Setup
LOW => LED_1 relay activated: Only the central LED (one in total) will be turned ON
MID => LED_4 realy activated: Only the periferial LEDS (four in total) will be turned ON
HIG => LED_1 && LED_4 relays activated: All LEDs will be turned ON (five in total)

On the other hand, the two FAN's relay will allow to completly control the INPUT and OUTPUT air flow:
IN      => FAN_I relay activated: Only INPUT FAN turned ON
OU      => FAN_O relay activated: Only OUTPUT FAN turned ON
IN-OU   => FAN_I && FAN_O realys activated: Total air cirulation (IN and OUT)

If digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH)  => Writes 3V to PIN => Relay Deactivated => Original NO/NC status.
If digitalWrite(PIN, LOW)   => Writes 0V to PIN => Relay Activated => Inverted NO/NC status
*/

/* ############################## Wiring
The wiring will be done using 2 (two) DB9 Serial connectors and UTP LAN cables (8 wires at total).

/* ############################## Calibrating Sensors
DHT22   =>  It is not necessary to calibrate this sensor (already calbirated in factory)
MOI     =>  Even that in some sites I found that it is recommended to feed the sensor with 5v, the current project considers 3.3v.
            The capacitive sensor needs to be calibrated with values of air (considered "dry") and water. This values
            will be "reference" to the function map(), as below:
            moi_raw = map(moi_unr, AirValue, WaterValue, 0, 100);
            moi_raw will be the value of the soil's moisture as a percentage, published on MQTT.
            As 20210629, cloudy day here in Salvador and very high ambient humidity (70%) I've measured:
            AirValue = 664 (set the value to 680 in order to adjust the humidity of the air)
            Water Value = 328 (set the value to 310 in order to adjust how much wet is the soil)
*/  

/* ############################## Cloud MQTT - MQTT Broker
Will be used the CloudMQTT Broker: https://www.cloudmqtt.com/ using a free "Cute Cat" plan.
Note: Plan Cute Cat is no longer available and is replaced by $5 Humble Hedgehog. For more information please read our announcement.
Consider to change MQTT Broker (even it is still working, I can't edit/change anything)
